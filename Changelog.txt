	ADDED: Deprecated Warnings in Log Files for V1 Protocols (be like a month or more before i remove them).
	ADDED: DB_Custom_V2 Protocol allows u to define SQL commands to run in a foo.ini file. 
		Basicly gives u freedom of Raw SQL commands without the added security risk, also option to use sanitize code or not.
